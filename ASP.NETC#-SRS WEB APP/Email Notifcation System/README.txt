This is the email notifcation system. It will send out emails everyday at 6:00PM.
Emails are only sent out if 3 days have passed since the request submission.
Emails are only sent out if the request is pending.
Emails are sent out to the Employee's manager.

There is a DEBUG boolean value at the top of the Program.cs, set this to true if you wish to test the program without sending actual emails.

The Email.exe is set-up to function properly (ie: if you run Email.exe and it sees that it's 6:00PM, it will send out emails.)
